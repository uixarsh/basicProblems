Fibonacci Series

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers (Fn) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

The first number in the sequence (F1) is 0, the second number (F2) is 1.

F1 = 0
F2 = 1
F3 = F1 + F2 = 0 + 1 => 1
F4 = F2 + F3 = 1 + 1 => 2
F5 = F3 + F4 = 1 + 2 => 3
F6 = F4 + F5 = 2 + 3 => 5
.

.
Fn = Fn-2 + Fn-1

Given a number (n), print the first n fibonacci numbers.

Example:
The first 6 fibonacci numbers are 0 1 1 2 3 5.

Input Format
The first line contains T denoting the no. of test cases.
Next T lines each containing a number.

Output Format
